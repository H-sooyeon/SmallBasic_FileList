  ttx["text1"]="Applesoft ~B was a ~d of ~B supplied with ` Apple II series of ~cs. It superseded Integer ~B & was ` ~B in ROM in all Apple II series ~cs after ` original Apple II model. ||FOR I = 1 TO 5 : FOR J = 1 TO I : PRINT ''*''; : NEXT J : PRINT : NEXT

  ttx["text2"]="~B is ` Beginner's All-purpose Symbolic In~tion Code. John G. Kemeny & Thomas E. Kurtz invented ~B at Dartmouth College during 1963 & 1964. (`ir implementation evolved into True ~B.)|~B became popular, with many different implementations for various ~cs. As ` decades passed, ` many ~ds of ~B diverged from ` original ~l. Though an ANSI st&ard exists for ~B, it is irrelevant to most ~B ~pmers, who only target one implementation of ~B.

  ttx["text3"]="~B Casio is ` high-level ~l used on Casio calculators. It is available on all Casio calculators despite some differences between versions. ~B Casio is designed To be simple & easy To learn for students. Its major drawback is its slowness especially when using graphical functions. ~B Casio is not affiliated with ~B & is not as similar To it as ` name would suggest. ~B Casio is equivalent To TI-~B on TI calculators.

  ttx["text4"]="~B-256 is an easy To use version of ~B designed To teach anybody (especially middle & high-school students) ` ~Bs of ~c ~pming. It uses traditional control ~tures like gosub, for/next, & Goto, which helps kids easily see how ~p flow-control works. It has a built-in graphics mode which lets `m draw pictures on screen in minutes, & a set of detailed, easy-To-follow tutorials that introduce ~pming concepts through fun exercises.

  ttx["text5"]="BBC ~B is a version of ` ~B ~pming ~l. It is notable for being one of ` few modern ~ds that makes no attempt to be compatible to any great degree with MS ~Bs.|BBC ~B was originally written for ` BBC Micro~c as part of ` BBC ~c Literacy Project under ` direction of ` British Broadcasting Corporation (thus ` name), but now runs on most modern, popular operating systems (& several older &/or less-popular ones).

  ttx["text6"]="Commodore ~B is ` collective name for ` various versions of ~B developed by MS for Commodore 8-bit ~cs, starting with ` PET in 1977. `re were several versions.|Commodore ~B is notable for its lack of integer arithmetic; all operations were carried out in floating-point, which made ` interpreter slower than some of its peers.|~ps were tokenized into bytecode, although many characters were left intact To facilitate printing ` source code back out in original form; it's one of ` few ~Bs of ` time that preserved whitespace (though not leading whitespace). Unlike some contemporary ~Bs, it supported arrays of strings, & arrays could have thous&s of elements as long as `re was sufficient memory for `m (but strings were limited to 255 bytes).|` most well-known version is 2.0, which came with ` VIC-20 & Commodore 64. Despite ` impressive sound & graphics capabilities of ` machines, ` ~l had no support for `m; machine code was required to take advantage of those features. Later ~B versions added support, but ` later machines that came with those versions never came close to ` popularity of ` 64.|In addition to ` sound & graphic statements, ` later versions also introduced ~tured ~pming con~ts: DO...LOOP, which supported both pre- & post-evaluated conditions (DO WHILE/UNTIL ... LOOP & DO ... LOOP WHILE/UNTIL) as well as unconditional loop exit (EXIT) & BEGIN...BEND code blocks, which allowed multi-line conditional clauses. However, o`r limitations remained: variables were still all global & limited to 2-letter names, user-defined functions were restricted to a single expression with a single argument, etc.

  ttx["text7"]="eh~B is a ~B variant designed for ` 6502. It is supposedly extremely portable & has a very clean simple syntax.|` author is Lee Davison.

  ttx["text8"]="Free~B is a free/open source (GPL), 32-bit ~B ~mer for MS ~w, protected-mode DOS (via a DOS extender), & Linux, with unofficial ports To Mac OS & FreeBSD.|Free~B makes use of ` GNU Binutils ~pming tools as backends, & can produce console, Quick~B-compatible graphical & GUI executables, along with dynamic & static libraries. A GCC frontend is under development, which will enable ~mation for many more operating systems than currently supported.|Currently, software libraries like GTK+, GSL, SDL, Allegro, Lua & OpenGL can be used directly (no wrappers, only function & ~ture prototypes), & more are being added on every new release. A complete set of ` ~w API headers is also ~ied.|` ~mer, & its nearly 90,000 lines of code, was, & still is, ~med by itself (in o`r words, Free~B is a self-hosting ~mer). ` first version of Free~B was written in Visual ~B for DOS for that purpose.

  ttx["text9"]="Future~B began life as Z~B, a commercial variant of ~B for ` early Macintoshes, but has grown far beyond that into a mature freeware IDE that, through its FBtoC translator, can be used To ~me C & ~oive-C ~o-oriented code using ` clang ~mer ~ied with an Xcode installation. It is excellent as a educational tool & for fast prototyping -- especially in ~oive-C (Cocoa) by those who prefer ~pmatic code over ` overhead of Xcode. Among its enthusiasts are commercial developers, engineers, professors, doctors, musicians, writers & a host of amateurs who ~p with FB for ` sheer joy of it.

  ttx["text10"]="FUZE ~B is ~ied, pre-configured & ready-To-run on ` FUZE, a ~c based on ` Raspberry Pi, but can also be installed, free of charge on a st&ard Raspberry Pi with some minor limitations due To a lack of on-board sensors which are added To ` FUZE hardware.

  ttx["text11"]="GFA ~B was a popular form of ~B for ` Atari ST ~c. It provided an integrated editor & interpreter, & ` ability To ~me code into st&alone ~ps. Full access was provided To ` Atari operating system (TOS, VDI & AES).GFA ~B for ` Atari ST can be used through an emulator; GFA ~B also runs on ` Atari-compatible Firebee.

  ttx["text12"]="STDOUT ''Hello world!''

  ttx["text13"]="GW-~B is a ~d of ` ~pming ~l ~B that was supplied with some versions of MSDOS. It replaced ~BA & was in turn replaced by Q~B.

  ttx["text14"]="Integer ~B, written by Steve Wozniak, was ` ~B interpreter of ` Apple I & original Apple II ~cs. Originally available on cassette, `n ~ied in ROM on ` original Apple II ~c at release in 1977.

  ttx["text15"]="IS-~B is ` ~d of ~B resident in ROM on ` Enterprise-64 & Enterprise-128 home ~c. It was developed by Intelligent Software in 1984. IS-~B adheres To ` ANSI ~B st&ard. It is a fully ~tured ~l whose wide set of control ~tures ~ies multi-line If...`N...Else, SELECT...CASE, DO...LOOP with While & UNTIL conditions at ` begin &/or end of ` loop & EXIT LOOP statement. Procedures & functions can have both reference & value parameters, & local variables. Errors & o`r exceptions are h&led with exception h&lers. IS-~B has ` unique ability To run multiple ~ps simultaneously in memory. Each ~p has a separate set of global variables & line numbers, but ` CHAIN statement makes it possible To call one ~p from ano`r & pass parameters between `m. Peripherals can be controlled directly from ~B, so `re is rarely a need To use POKE & PEEK statements. IS-~B has ` usual comm&s for drawing dots, lines, circles & ellipses & for filling areas, & supports Logo-style turtle graphics. Sound comm&s can be entered into a queue, & executed in ` background While ` ~p execution continues.

  ttx["text16"]="IW~B is a 32-bit ~B ~mer from Ionic Wind Software featuring an integrated development environment with syntax similar To ` ~B ~pming ~l.

  ttx["text17"]="Liberty ~B is a procedural ~pming ~l for ~w PCs, created by Shoptalk Systems. It was intended as a simple way To create professional ~ps, with full GUI ability, While still keeping a very simple ~B syntax. While ` current version only supports ~w, ` next major release will support Mac OS X & Linux as well. Liberty ~B runs under Wine on Linux at present.

  ttx["text18"]="` LibreOffice ~B (once called OpenOffice.org ~B) ~pming ~l has been developed especially for LibreOffice & is firmly integrated in ` LibreOffice package.|As ` name suggests, OpenOffice.org ~B is a ~pming ~l from ` ~B family. Anyone who has previously worked with o`r ~B ~ls ?? in particular with Visual ~B or Visual ~B for Applications (VBA) from MS ?? will quickly become accustomed To LibreOffice ~B. Large sections of ` ~B con~ts of LibreOffice ~B are compatible with Visual ~B.

  ttx["text19"]="Locomotive ~B is a variant of ~B that is built into ` ROM of ` Amstrad CPC series of Z80-based home ~cs introduced in 1984. In ` 1980s, CPCs were a popular, slightly more expensive alternative To ` Commodore C64/C128 & were not just suited for games but also office work because of `ir high resolution displays & CP/M support. `y came with a built-in cassette deck (CPC 464) or 3' disk drive (CPC 664 & 6128) as storage devices & a ''green screen'' or color monitor which also housed ` power supply. Sales were particularly strong in ` UK, Germany, France, & Spain. Today, Locomotive ~B can be used via CPC emulators such as WinAPE or JavaCPC?”which is perfectly legal because Amstrad has given `ir permission for distributing CPC ROM images with emulators.

  ttx["text20"]="MS Small ~B (not To be confused with Small~B) is a ~B ~mer for ` .Net Framework, largely aimed at absolute beginners. It is an extremely simplified variant of ` ~B ~l, & can be thought of as a sort of Q~B.Net. In fact, its creator has called it a modern-day Q~B. But it is a ~l & not an implementation because it has its own syntax.

  ttx["text21"]="MSX ~B is ` ~B built into ` ROM of ` MSX compatible ~cs.|MSX ~B is a ~d of ` ~B ~pming ~l. It is an extended version of MS St&ard ~B Version 4.5, & ~ies support for graphic, music, & various peripherals attached To MSX Personal ~cs. Generally, MSX-~B is designed To follow GW-~B.

  ttx["text22"]="Oxygen~B is a ~mable ~l in ` ~B genre supporting ~o-oriented ~pming, & containing features of C. Its earliest origins was as a macro Assembly code ~l in 2009, but subsequently acquired all ` features of a high-level ~l.|` philosophy underlying Oxygen~B is to facilitate clean coding, with low syntax noise & few coding restrictions. ` core ~l & ~mer size are kept to a minimum.

  ttx["text23"]="Power~B is a small family of ~mers for DOS & ~w by Power~B, Inc. Its main selling point is ` efficiency of ` ~mer & its ease of use. ` ''easy'' part is debatable: working with ~w is not as easy as Visual ~B, but `n, almost nothing is.

  ttx["text24"]="Pure~B is a high-level ~pming ~l by Fantaisie Software based on ~B rules. Pure~B has been created for beginners & experts alike.|Pure~B is a portable ~pming ~l with current up-To-date implementations on ~w, Linux, & MacOS. ` same code can be ~med & run natively on each OS. An older version for ` Amiga platform is also available, but no longer maintained.

  ttx["text25"]="Q~B is a ~B that was written by MS & normally executes under ~w.

  ttx["text26"]="QL ~B known as Super~B is an advanced variant of ` ~B ~pming ~l with many ~tured ~pming additions. It was developed at Sinclair Research by Jan Jones during ` early 1980s. Originally Super~B was intended for a home ~c, code-named SuperSpectrum, `n under development. This project was later cancelled; however, Super~B was subsequently ~ied in ` ROM firmware of ` Sinclair QL micro~c (announced in January 1984), also serving as ` comm& line interpreter for ` QL's Qdos operating system. It is notable for being ` first second-generation ~B to be integrated into a micro~c's operating system, so making ` latter user-extendable?”as exemplified by Linus Torvalds in his formative years.

  ttx["text27"]="Quite ~B was written by Nikko Strom as a hobby, however it is now a website, a web application, educational resource, & application development tool for classic ~B.

  ttx["text28"]="REAL~B (or RB) is a ~B ~mer for ~w, Mac OS, & Linux, made by Xojo, Inc. It has its own IDE, & projects are saved To a proprietary binary format. Unlike most ~Bs, REAL~B is heavily ~o-oriented.|As of June 2013, ` ~l, IDE, & company have been re-br&ed as Xojo.|REAL~B is not compatible with o`r ~Bs, for ` most part; examples from o`r ~Bs usually have To be completely rewritten To work in RB.

  ttx["text29"]="Run ~B is a web application server, based on Liberty ~B.|Run ~B serves a similar purpose To o`r ~ls like ASP, Perl, & PHP; unlike those ~ls, however, it is not an add-on module To web servers, instead ~iing its own HTTP server. Web pages are generated dynamically by ` ~p. High-level comm&s automatically generate HTML, colors, fonts, backgrounds, & Cascading Style Sheets (CSS). If needed, JavaScript can also be injected into a page. Graphics can be drawn & rendered via code. Files can be fetched from o`r web sites using GET & POST, & a built-in XML parser can be used To extract data.|Database capability is ~ied via ` SQLite database engine.

  ttx["text30"]="S-~B (` S st&s for ''~tured'') was a native-code ~mer for an ALGOL-like ~d of ` ~B ~pming ~l, & ran on 8-bit micro~cs using ` Z80 CPU & ` CP/M operating system. (`re are a number of CP/M or Z80 emulators that will allow ` ~mer To run on ~w or Linux systems.) ` ~l & ` ~mer were developed during ` period 1979-1981 by Gilbert Ohnysty, who saw a need for a true native-code ~mer & a ~l implementation that preserved ~B's ease of use & straight-forward syntax, while incorporating ` syntactic & control-flow features associated with modern ~pming ~ls.

  ttx["text31"]="Script~B is an interpreted ~B suitable for general purpose terminal mode application ~pming & common gateway interface scripting.

  ttx["text32"]="Sinclair ZX81 ~B is ` ~d of ~B resident in ROM on ` ZX81 home ~c (1981) & compatibles (Timex Sinclair 1000, Lambda 8300, & many o`rs). It was developed by John Grant & Steve Vickers. Around 1.5 million ZX81s & 'official' compatibles were sold, toge`r with a substantial number of clones (unofficial compatibles) manufactured in Brazil, Hong Kong, & elsewhere.|ZX81 ~B is almost a subset of ZX Spectrum ~B, but not quite: ` exponentiation operator is spelled ** ra`r than ?†‘ (mapped to ASCII ^), ` jump & subroutine call keywords are spelled GOTO & GOSUB ra`r than GO TO & GO SUB, etc. Note also that ` ZX81 uses an idiosyncratic (non-ASCII) character set, so that ` CODE & CHR$ functions do not return ` same values as `y would on ` Spectrum. Floating point operations, some string h&ling, & low-resolution graphics are supported; colour, sound, user-defined functions, ` READ, DATA, & RESTORE keywords, & assorted o`r features are not.

  ttx["text33"]="Smart ~B is an extension of ` very popular ~B ~pming ~l originally developed by Dartmouth College way back in 1964. With Smart ~B you can write ~B ~ps directly on iOS devices.|Using Apple's Xcode platform along with ` freely provided smart ~B SDK, you can actually ~p in ~B within Xcode, test your code in iOS simulators or your own iOS device, & even build st&-alone apps for submission to ` App Store to sell, with no royalty issues.

  ttx["text34"]="Smile~B demo:|PRINT ''Hello world!''

  

  ttx["text43"]="With Visual ~B, you can create applications for ~w, ` Web, mobile devices, & Office on ` .NET Framework. Visual ~B .NET makes it easy To create ~w form applications quickly & efficiently. ` ~l is ~o-oriented & has unique features To speed development & deployment.|Visual ~B .NET, like C# & o`r .NET ~ls, runs on ` MS Common ~l Runtime VM.|Not To be confused with Visual ~B, ` original pre-.NET, implementation, which has only a passing resemblance To VB.NET.
