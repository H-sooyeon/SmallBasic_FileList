'Spin/Roll Effect Example - by Matthew L. Parets aka codingCat

'The effect suggests the spinning of a slot machine wheel

'This effect takes advantage of the fact that small basic layers 

'shapes as they are created. New shapes are created on top

'of previous created shapes.



GraphicsWindow.Show()

GraphicsWindow.PenColor = "Black"  ' Change to white to see the full effect

circ = Shapes.AddEllipse(25,25)    'A shape on the wheel

GraphicsWindow.BrushColor = "black" ' Change to white to see the full effect

bottom = Shapes.AddRectangle(30,30) 'The rectangles will be created on top of the circle

top = Shapes.AddRectangle(30,30)



Shapes.Move(top, 300,100)     'Move the rectangles to the middle of the screen

Shapes.Move(bottom, 300,160)

Shapes.Move(circ, 303,100)    'hide the circle behind the top rectangle



circY = 100                   'Starting place for circle



While "True"

  circY = circY + 1           'Move the circle down a dot

  If circY > 160 Then         'Are we fully behind the bottom rectangle?

    circY = 100               'Move up behind the top rectangle

  EndIf

  Shapes.Move(circ, 303,circY)  'Move the circle

  Program.Delay(10)             'wait for a second

EndWhile
