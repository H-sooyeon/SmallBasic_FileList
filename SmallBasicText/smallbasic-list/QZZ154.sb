'Lesson 1.5  Branching and Subroutines

'Write a program that opens a text window and then performs the following steps:

'1.Asks the user for the name, temperature, rain status, and wind status of 10 cities.

'2.Uses branching and subroutines to determine and display the total number of:

'Cold Cities, Cool Cities, Warm Cities, Hot Cities, Rainy Cities, Windy Cities.



'asks the user for city name, temp and weather inputs



While c < 10

  TextWindow.WriteLine("City Name Please: ")

  cityname =  TextWindow.Read()

  TextWindow.WriteLine("City Temperature Please: cool, cold, warm or hot? ")

  citytemp = TextWindow.Read()

  TextWindow.WriteLine("City climate pls: windy or rainy ")

  Windorrain = TextWindow.Read()

  count_windy_or_rainy()

  TextWindow.WriteLine("")

  TextWindow.WriteLine("now for the next city")

  TextWindow.WriteLine("")

  

  'call subroutines to count temps and weather

  count_citytemp()

  count_windy_or_rainy()

  c=c+1

EndWhile



'to display the  final count of each type of city



If c = 10 then

TextWindow.WriteLine("Thank you")

TextWindow.WriteLine("There are " + countcool + " cool cities.")

TextWindow.WriteLine("There are " + countcold + " cold cities.")

TextWindow.WriteLine("There are " + countwarm + " warm cities.")

TextWindow.WriteLine("There are " + counthot +  " hot cities.")
