'Write a program that calculates the area and circumference of a circle based on it's

'diameter:

'1. Ask the user to specify the diameter of a circle.

'2. Create a variable that is called Diameter, & store  the value from the user in it.

'3. Create a variable that is called Radius, calculate the circle's radius, & store the result

'in that variable.

'4. Create variables that are called Area & Circumference, calculate the area & 

'circumference of the circle, & store the values in those variables.

'5. Display the area & circumference of the circle.



TextWindow.Write("What is the diameter of the circle? ")

diameter = TextWindow.ReadNumber()

radius = diameter / 2

area = (3.14) * radius * radius

circumference = (3.14) * 2 * radius

TextWindow.WriteLine("The area of the circle is " + area)

TextWindow.WriteLine("The circumference of the circle is " + circumference)
