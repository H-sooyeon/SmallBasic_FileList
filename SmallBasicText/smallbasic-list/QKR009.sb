'Take it easy... This program kept crashing on my computer because I was trying to draw too fast... Maybe it's the logic I'm using?

'Slower movements are okay though.

'My computer has a Dual-Core processor running at 1.7 GHz ... If you have anything better than that, change the Program.Delay() values to make it run better :P

'I have code at the bottom for a CPU Load Reducer that tries to pause the program when CPU Load is above 90%

'Feel free to tinker with it, maybe make it a While Loop so it will stay paused until load drops.







'GW Setup

GraphicsWindow.Title = "Drawing Mirror"

GraphicsWindow.Width = 500

GraphicsWindow.Height = 500

GraphicsWindow.Top = 0'(Desktop.Height - 500)/2

GraphicsWindow.Left = 0'(Desktop.Width - 500)/2

GraphicsWindow.BackgroundColor = "Black"



'Watch for Mouse Move

GraphicsWindow.MouseMove = MouseMove





'MouseMove Sub

Sub MouseMove

  'While GW is being clicked

  While Mouse.IsLeftButtonDown = "True"

    'Put If...  here if you want to (First Spot)

    'Get X/Y Co-ords of Mouse

    X = Mouse.MouseX - 10

    Y = Mouse.MouseY - 30

    'Draw where mouse is

    GraphicsWindow.PenColor = "Yellow"

    GraphicsWindow.DrawEllipse(X, Y, 3, 3)

    'Pause for 20 ms and then draw mirror

    Program.Delay(20)

    GraphicsWindow.PenColor = "Green"

    GraphicsWindow.DrawEllipse(500-X, 500-Y, 3, 3)

    'Small delay before doing this again

    Program.Delay(5)

    'Put elseif...endif here if you want to (Second Spot)

  EndWhile

EndSub





'>>-------------------------CPU Load reducer---------------------------<<

'This stuff goes into the while loop within the MouseMove Subroutine. You'll find comments about where to put it.

'Either delete those comments when you move this code or keep them, the compiler doesn't mind :P





'This If...ElseIf...End statement is makes sure the program pauses if CPU is over 90% but runs if CPU is under 90% load



'------------------First Chunk (Goes in first spot for this code)-------------------

'If Hardware.CPUUsage < 90 Then

'  'Remove pause message

'  Shapes.Remove(Pause)



'-----------------Second Chunk (Goes in second spot for this code)-------------------

'ElseIf Hardware.CPUUsage > 90 then

'  'Try to slow program a bit

'  Program.Delay(20)

'  'Display message

'  GraphicsWindow.BrushColor = "Red"

'  Pause = Shapes.AddText("CPU over 90% Load. Waiting...")

'  Shapes.Move(Pause, 50, 250)

'EndIf
