  'In this game "Age Of Heroes" there are many places that one could think i have "slacked off a little"  and not done as much as i could
  'e.g.: not using a random number generator instead of an actual dice but as it states in the opening credits this is a DND simulator.
  'my intentions in making this is to make the program simulate the dungeon master and the player dose what he would do in a real DND  game
  'like rolling one’s own dice.

  '(what you see here is my first attempt at a text adventure) I hope to update the quests regally on a monthly basis or so.
  'so now I can introduce to you AGE OF HEROES (version 1.0)
