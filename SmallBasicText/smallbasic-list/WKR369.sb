'to draw that same star using  for loop requires (for me) that the turn angles are known.

'looking at first star drawn
'if "S" is the starting point for the turtle (80,80) then in moving to "S1" (100,130) it travels
'approx 53.85 (pixels?) - pythogoras gives this distance - it's the length of each side of our star.
'applying some of the trig that I assured my maths teacher I'd never need 
'the angle inside the star at "S" is 2 x 20.80 (approx) = 41.6 degrees. 
'and the angle outside that star S1 = 90 + 41.6 = 131.6 degrees
