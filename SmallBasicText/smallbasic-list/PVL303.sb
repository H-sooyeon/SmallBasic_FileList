'1. Create a file filled with a given number of randomly generated characters or lines.
'2. Split a given file (eg. from 1.) to a specified number (eg. 3) of parts like FileName_1.part to FileName_3.part and save these into a folder.
'3. Merge all the FileName_N.part files from a folder into a combined file again.
'4. Compare two files (eg. orig. file from 1. and merged file from 3.) if they are identical.
'5. Bonus: If you do all from above, combine the functions 1.-4. into a single program.
