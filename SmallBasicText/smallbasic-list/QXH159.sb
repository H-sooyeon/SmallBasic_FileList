'This is a solution to the Euler Project Problem 28.
'This program solves the problem by viewing the diagonals
'as four different sequences of numbers.

sum = 0
For i = 1 To 501 '(There are 501 numbers in every sequence.)
  ur = 4 * i*i - 4 * i + 1 'Sequence from middle to the upper right
  ul = 4 * i*i - 6 * i + 3 'Sequence from middle to the upper left
  lr = 4 * i*i - 10 * i + 7 'Sequence from middle to the lower right
  ll = 4 * i*i - 8 * i + 5 'Sequence from middle to the lower left
  sum = sum + ur + ul + lr + ll 'The sum of the numbers
EndFor
