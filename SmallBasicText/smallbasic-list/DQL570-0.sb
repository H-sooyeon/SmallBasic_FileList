'The file SoundPlay.txt, loaded from the program directory configures the app

'Format of SoundPlay.txt: ----------

'Line 1 of SoundPlay.txt: WaitForSoundToEnd = false

'     true = sounds do not interrupt each other, false = sounds will interrupt each other

'Line 2 of SoundPlay.txt: The number of keys mapped to sounds

'Lines 3 - ???: the sound file and key mappings for those sounds

'    Odd numbered lines = the key that will play the sound (as returned by GraphicsWindow.lastkey

'    Even numbered lines = the file name of the sound to play
