' Comment: http://1drv.ms/1z2QGdG (filtered[1].txt)
'  filtered[1].txt is a list of 970 words sorted in alphabetical order with 1 word per line.
'  Basically I want to pluck a word at random from words. Only using the word once.
'  I could be a bit stubborn here, but I wish to host only 1 txt file on the server
'  that contains words of 3 or more letters that are sorted in alphabetical order, line by line.
'  I might need an upfront word count and the File would need to be d/loaded as a temp file.
